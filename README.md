### Introduction :

I developed this project as part of the Mini-Project course in Semester 5 with my team. It consists of a mobile app connected to a web portal for emergencies through a Socket.IO server, enabling bidirectional communication. The project is designed to enhance womenâ€™s safety and general well-being.

### Tech-Stack :

- **App** : This application is developed using _Expo_ for mobile development, with _Firebase_ serving as the backend to handle real-time database, authentication, and cloud functions. _Redux_ is utilized for efficient and predictable state management, while _TypeScript_ is employed to ensure type safety and enhance the overall developer experience.
- **WebPortal** : This web portal is developed using _Vite_ for fast and efficient bundling, _Redux_ for state management, and _React Router DOM_ for seamless client-side routing.
- **Server** : This application is developed using _Express_ and _Socket.IO_ to enable dual communication and integrates _Twilio Cloud Communications_ for SMS functionality.

### Installation :

Use the command `npm install` to install all the required dependencies.

### Usage :

Install the Expo Go application from the Play Store. After running the command `npx expo start`, a QR code will be displayed. Scan the QR code with Expo Go to proceed and use the app.
To run the website and server, use the command `npm run dev`.
